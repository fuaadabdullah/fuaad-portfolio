# Portfolio

Personal assets and companion docs that complement the main monorepo work.

- `resume.md` — Latest resume draft.
- `projects/` — Space for write-ups and collateral that do not belong under `apps/` yet.

Keep binaries (PDFs, images) in dedicated subfolders and avoid spaces in new filenames.
