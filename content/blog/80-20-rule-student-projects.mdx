## The Problem with Student Projects

Most student projects never ship. They die in the "almost done" phase.

Why? **Scope creep** and **perfectionism**.

You start with:
- A simple MVP idea
- 2-week timeline
- Core features only

You end up with:
- 15 "nice to have" features
- 3 months of development
- Zero users
- Burnout

## The 80/20 Solution

The Pareto Principle: **20% of your features deliver 80% of the value.**

Your job is to find that 20% and ship it.

### Example: RIZZK Calculator

**What I could have built** (100% version):
- Risk calculator ✅
- Trade journal 📝
- Portfolio tracker 📊
- Social features 👥
- Historical data analysis 📈
- Mobile app 📱
- Push notifications 🔔
- Advanced charting 📉

**What I actually built** (20% version):
- Risk calculator ✅

**Result**: 500+ users in 6 months. Clean, focused, fast.

## How to Find Your 20%

Ask yourself:

### 1. What's the ONE problem I'm solving?

Not "help traders manage their portfolio." That's too broad.

Instead: **"Tell traders how much they can risk on the next trade."**

### 2. What's the simplest version that works?

Not "full-featured trading platform."

Instead: **"A calculator with 4 inputs and 3 outputs."**

### 3. Can I ship this in 2 weeks?

If no, cut more features.

If yes, ship it. Then iterate.

## The 2-Week Sprint Framework

Here's how I ship projects:

### Week 1: Build Core Features
- **Day 1-2**: Set up project, basic UI
- **Day 3-5**: Core functionality
- **Day 6-7**: Polish, basic testing

### Week 2: Ship & Iterate
- **Day 8-9**: Deploy to production
- **Day 10-11**: Get feedback, fix bugs
- **Day 12-14**: Add one polish feature, market

## Real Examples

### Good: 20% Focus

| Project | Core Feature | Time | Users |
|---------|-------------|------|-------|
| RIZZK | Risk calculator | 2 weeks | 500+ |
| My Portfolio | Project showcase | 1 week | Live |
| MVP Bootstrap Service | Template setup | 2 weeks | $1,500/client |

### Bad: 100% Ambition

| Project | Scope | Time | Users |
|---------|-------|------|-------|
| "All-in-one trading platform" | 20+ features | 6 months | 0 (never shipped) |
| "Social network for students" | Complex backend | 4 months | 0 (burned out) |

## How to Cut Features

Use this decision tree:

```
Is this feature required for the MVP to work?
  ├─ Yes → Build it
  └─ No → Does it solve the core problem?
      ├─ Yes → Add to v2 roadmap
      └─ No → Delete forever
```

Be ruthless. Your v2 can have more features **if v1 gets users**.

## The Shipping Mindset

### Wrong mindset:
> "I need to add X, Y, Z features before anyone will use this."

### Right mindset:
> "I'll ship the simplest version that solves the problem, then learn what users actually need."

## Action Steps

1. **List all features** you want to build
2. **Circle the ONE** that solves your core problem
3. **Cut everything else** for v1
4. **Ship in 2 weeks**
5. **Get feedback** and iterate

## Key Takeaways

- 20% of features = 80% of value
- Ship the smallest version that solves the core problem
- 2-week sprints force focus
- Iterate based on user feedback, not assumptions
- Done > Perfect

**Your first version should embarrass you a little.** If it doesn't, you waited too long to ship.
