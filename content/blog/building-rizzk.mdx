## The Problem

Most day traders lose money. Not because they can't read charts or spot patterns, but because they don't manage risk properly.

I saw this firsthand when I started trading in college. Smart people making emotional decisions. Overtrading. Overleveraging. Blowing up accounts.

The tools out there were either:
- **Too complex**: Enterprise-grade platforms with 100 features traders don't need
- **Too simple**: Basic calculators that don't account for real trading scenarios
- **Too expensive**: $50+/month subscriptions for students and beginners

## The Solution: RIZZK Calculator

I built [RIZZK](https://rizzk-calculator-demo-eus2-f1.azurewebsites.net) as a focused, free tool that answers one question:

> **"How much can I risk on this trade?"**

Read the full case study with screenshots and technical details on my [RIZZK portfolio page](/portfolio/rizzk-calculator).

Key features:
- Account size and risk percentage inputs
- Position sizing based on stop-loss distance
- Break-even and profit target calculations
- Mobile-first design (traders check on their phones)
- **Zero cost, zero friction**

## What I Learned

### 1. Distribution > Features

The first version had fancy charts and historical tracking. Usage was low.

I stripped it down to the core calculator and added a **one-click share** feature. Usage exploded.

**Lesson**: People don't want more features. They want solutions to their immediate problem.

### 2. Free ≠ Low Quality

Charging $5/month would've made me $2,500/month (500 users). But it would've kept 90% of users away.

Going free meant:
- **More feedback** from real users
- **Portfolio piece** that demonstrates my skills
- **Proof of execution** for future projects

**Lesson**: Sometimes the value isn't the revenue—it's the distribution and credibility.

### 3. Tech Stack Matters (For Learning)

I built RIZZK with:
- **Next.js** (React framework)
- **FastAPI** (Python backend)
- **Azure** (hosting and CI/CD)

This forced me to learn full-stack development, DevOps, and cloud infrastructure—skills I use daily now.

**Lesson**: Side projects are the best classroom.

## What's Next

RIZZK is stable and serving 500+ users. Here's what's coming:

1. **Multi-asset support** (options, futures, crypto)
2. **Trade journal integration** (track actual vs. planned risk)
3. **Mobile app** (PWA first, native later)

But the bigger goal is proving a model:

> **Build focused, free tools for niche audiences. Own the problem, not the price.**

## Key Takeaways

- Solve one problem exceptionally well
- Free tools can be high-quality portfolio pieces
- Distribution beats features every time
- Side projects are learning accelerators
